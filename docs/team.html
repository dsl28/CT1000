        <h1>Meet the Project Team!</h1>
        
        <h2>Marisa Lee</h2>
        <p>I am an IT major! I have always been interested in working in the IT field. I never knew much about trains before this project but it was fun to learn more about them! 
            The part of the project I liked the most was learning about how to create a website, I did not realize how much work goes into creating one! 
            When Iâ€™m not working or studying I like to crochet, read, play games and make jewelry!</p>
        
       <h2>Alec Craig</h2>
        
        <p>
            Alec Craig is an Information Technology major at the University of Pittsburgh Greensburg whom is also pursuing a Computer Science minor. 
            Although I do not know much about the more complex aspects of the train system, I had a fascination of trains when I was a kid, making me feel happy 
            to be included with this project. My long-term goal in life is to master programming so I can create and design my own video games, free for the world 
            to play. To accomplish this, I am considering to switching to UPG's main campus in Oakland to pursue their Digital Narrative and Interactive Design course,
            to further improve on my love for creation.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Andrew Raith</h2>
        
        <p>
            Andrew Raith is a history major with a minor in English literature. I freely admit to being of those train people and I am
            always quite happy to share knowledge on the subject. I am an avid model railroader and volunteer with several rail-preservation
            projects to work on the real thing as well as models. Involvement in project CT-1000 was more or less by accident, despite being 
            exactly the sort of person that would end up on a project like this. Outside of a deciedely railroad dominated life, I enjoy 
            music, drawing, restoration of various antiques, and I play guitar. 
            
        </p>
        
        <h2>Dylan Leonard</h2>
        <p>is a history major with a love for railroad and industrial history. I can typically be found researching niche topics,
            fixing antique equipment, or enjoying the hobby of model railroading. I'm also a dedicated photographer that always looks for
            interesting scenes to capture, especially if they have historic interest. One day while debating over project ideas, Andrew Raith and I
            decided that the relatively difficult to find CT-1000 was an excellent primary source for a project like this. To my surprise, others
            were willing to be part of my team!
        </p>
        
        <h2>Hunter Johnson</h2>
        <p>I'm a history major! The only train I knew was Thomas the tank engine but taking a train ride would be super fun. I hope to one day be curator at a museum, honestly at any museum I like them all.
        I have two cats who take up all my time, I enjoy reading, and I enjoy the outdoors. I don't have many hobbies cause in this economy who can afford them.
