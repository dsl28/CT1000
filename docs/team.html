        <p>is a history major with a love for railroad and industrial history. I can typically be found researching niche topics,
            fixing antique equipment, or enjoying the hobby of model railroading. I'm also a dedicated photographer that always looks for
            interesting scenes to capture, especially if they have historic interest. One day while debating over project ideas, Andrew Raith and I
            decided that the relatively difficult to find CT-1000 was an excellent primary source for a project like this. To my surprise, others
            were willing to be part of my team!
