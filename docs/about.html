        <h1>What is a CT1000?</h1>
        <p>Simply put, the "CT" in the title means "Conducting Transportation" as these data books were internal, uncirculated publications intended to be used to aid train movements in certain areas.
        The earliest known examples of these books were issued in 1878, and continued until the version presented here, dated for May 1st, 1945. </p>
        
        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>Within the pages of the CT1000, the entire Pennsylvania Railroad system is included, we chose to only cover the railroad's Pittsburgh division, covering Altoona-Pittsburgh and branches. Industries, railroad facilities, stations, branches, and connections
        with other railroads are given by location, and are assigned a code. They are grouped in order, using mileposts that use distances from points as a reference (I.E., Altoona).</p>
        
        <h1>Creating the Project:</h1>
        <p>From the beginning, we knew that the CT1000 was effectively an analog form of a database, and would transfer relatively neatly into XML in order to be processed. The nature of PDF scans, in addition to a typewritten format meant that optical
        character recognition was acceptable, but required extensive manual cleanup. The same can be said for the nuance required in the XML markup process. It made sense to offer a visualization of stations, much like that of a subway map or timetable as part of the 
        project to show the presence of heavy passenger traffic. For freight, grouping of industries showcased local trends. A table of all industries and their types is valuable for those searching for specific customers. </p>
        
        <h1>Closing Thoughts:</h1>
       <p>Ultimately, we were able to bring a historic document to life, just a few weeks short of its 80th birthday. The end of WWII marked the return of a peacetime economy, but competition from airlines, personal motoriss, and the trucking industry
       harmed railroading. By 1952, the PRR had its worst financial year on record. By 1968, the ailing company merged with once rival New York Central to become Penn Central. This failed, and a group purchase of northeastern roads resulted in Conrail in April 1976. 
       In 1999, Conrail was broken up and today, Norfolk Southern operates the line.</p>
