        <h1>What is the project goal?</h1>
        <p>In creating our project, the intent was to convert a CT1000 into a readable document and offer its contents for easy access to people that may not be extremely well-versed in hyperlocal railroad history.
        We also found it to be crucial to represent the branch structure of the railroad to show the PRR's extensive operating presence in Western Pennsylvania. Also, we were curious to see how many stations existed in 1945, and the number and types of industries.</p>
        
        <h1>Why 1945?</h1>
        <p>This was the final issue of the CT1000 and also a symbolic one, since this was the only issue to occur during WWII, albeit in the final months of the war where western railroads would have played a greater role shipping material and troops to the Pacific.</p>
        
      <h1>What is a CT1000?</h1>
        <p>Simply put, the "CT" in the title means "Conducting Transportation" as these data books were internal, uncirculated publications intended to be used to aid train movements in certain areas.
        The earliest known examples of these books were issued in 1878, and continued until the version presented here, dated for May 1st, 1945. </p>
        
        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>Within the pages of the CT1000, the entire Pennsylvania Railroad system is included, we chose to only cover the railroad's Pittsburgh division, covering Altoona-Pittsburgh and branches. Industries, railroad facilities, stations, branches, and connections
        with other railroads are given by location, and are assigned a code. They are grouped in order, using mileposts that use distances from points as a reference (I.E., Altoona).</p>
        
        <h1>Creating the Project:</h1>
        <p>From the beginning, we knew that the CT1000 was effectively an analog form of a database, and would transfer relatively neatly into XML in order to be processed. The nature of PDF scans, in addition to a typewritten format meant that optical
        character recognition was acceptable, but required extensive manual cleanup. The same can be said for the nuance required in the XML markup process. It made sense to offer a visualization of stations, much like that of a subway map or timetable as part of the 
        project to show the presence of heavy passenger traffic. For freight, grouping of industries showcased local trends. A table of all industries and their types is valuable for those searching for specific customers. We also added lists of all stations and
        industries found along the Pittsburgh Division to add depth beyond our raw data and schematics. These lists were generated using Xquery, and effectively filtered the data from each entry in the CT1000 neatly into our visualizations.</p>
        
        <h1>Closing Thoughts:</h1>
       <p>Ultimately, we were able to bring a historic document to life, just a few weeks short of its 80th birthday. The end of WWII marked the return of a peacetime economy, but competition from airlines, personal motoriss, and the trucking industry
       harmed railroading. By 1952, the PRR had its worst financial year on record. By 1968, the ailing company merged with once rival New York Central to become Penn Central. This failed, and a group purchase of northeastern roads resulted in Conrail in April 1976. 
       In 1999, Conrail was broken up and today, Norfolk Southern operates the line. In the future, the project will likely be expanded to cover other divisions of the railroad, starting with the Monongahela and Conemaugh lines. From there, following the mainline eastbound
       from Altoona through Tyrone, Huntingdon, and Lewistown over the Middle Division seems feasible.</p>
